#Apex Legends Random Legend Select

**Description**: This is a learning project. The goal here is to allow for a few different random Legend Select features while playing Apex Legends either solo, or with your friends.

**Features**: If your progit ject has multiple features, list them here. Donâ€™t be afraid to brag if your project has unique features that make it stand out. You can even add screenshots and gifs to show off the features.

**How to use**: Run directly from your code editor or deploy to your own server.

**Technologies**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Soon to implement Typescript.

**Collaborators**: Chat GPT is the homie. So is Knuckles.
